\CIMabstract{
Wrist-wearable vibrotactile arrays can serve many functions: typically they are used for non-disruptive notification from social media. They can also be used for direction finding, gaming and entertainment. Authoring and programming of wrist-wearable vibrotactile arrays can be difficult because of the lack of a standardized notational system and standard file formats. Typically, each implementation of haptic arrays uses bespoke programming, which tends to isolate creative and technical development into non-communicating silos and discourage standardization and sharing. We propose that standard musical notation is an appropriate method for standardization and compositional expressiveness}.
