\textbf{Introduction}\\
\NORMAL{}
Wrist-wearable vibrotactile arrays can serve many functions: typically they are used for non-disruptive notification from social media. They can also be used for direction finding, gaming and entertainment. Authoring and programming of wrist-wearable vibrotactile arrays can be difficult because of the lack of standardized notational systems and file formats. We propose that standard musical notation is an appropriate method for standardization and compositional expressiveness.

\textbf{What?}\\
\NORMAL{}
We are developing a MIDI-driven, wrist-wearable device that integrates with a gaming app on an accompanying smartphone. The wrist device includes LED lights, vibe motors and buttons that activate when vibe motors are touched. A wrist-wearable vibrotactile device, or what we call a \textit{vibe bracelet}, needs activation patterns to operate. It is unclear how to design such patterns in a standardized way using the technology closest at hand, which in our case is low-level code written in the C or Wiring languages.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%Music notation is a finely structured notational system. It requires an expert-level of competence to read its finest levels of detail, however, this type of expertise is not hard to find in cultures where notated musical composition and performance is well-established. What is much less common is cross-expertise in both music notation and vibrotactile technologies. Designing interesting and functionally useful patterns for vibrotactile devices is obviously a new field. Standard musical notation includes many dimensions but in its standard forms does not easily lend itself to inclusion of additional non-musical dimensions such as required for the specification of 2 and 3D spatial patterns. These sorts of patterns are important to represent for vibrotactile devices.\\

%\textbf{Basic mapping conventions}\\
%\SMALL{}
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Represent time horizontally from left to right. Notes to the right occur later.
%\item A note represents an activation of a component. A component can be of several types (vibe motor, LED, etc.). Place notes on normal, five line staves.
%\item Represent note durations by note type (for example, quarter, half and whole notes), dots and by ties between notes of the same pitch.
%\item If notes are pitched, indicate their pitch through their vertical placement on a staff. If notes are unpitched, represent different components (e.g. different types of vibe motors or LEDs) using various note heads or annotations.
%\item Different \textit{parts} are on separate staves. One tactor type playing the same notes at the same time represents playing in \textit{unison}. For example, eight vibe motors playing in unison can be represented as one part.
%\item Simultaneous notes, or \textit{chords}, are stacked vertically as in music notation.

%We also need to translate the nomenclature from the domain of wrist wearables to that of music notation. This mapping is shown in the following table:

%Therefore, the basic components of music are present even with a wrist-wearable vibrotactile device that does not, at first, seem to have a musical aspect: \textit{notes} with durations, pitched notes played on various discrete \textit{instruments} (vibe motors and LED lights), various \textit{parts,} or \textit{voices,} played in polyphonic \textit{compositions} and the dynamics of various parts playing together. \\

%\normalsize \color{red}
%\textbf{Pitch}
%\SMALL{}
%Vertical placement for normal, pitched notes in music notation indicates their pitch. Pitch differentials are possible with tactors, as their frequency can be modelled using standard pulse-width modulation (PWM) techniques \cite{lindeman2006wearable}. The pitch of a note is one of its primary psychoacoustic attributes, along with its duration, loudness and timbre. Unpitched notes are those for which the frequency is indeterminate, too complex or unrelated to the pitch contours of melodic or harmonic parts. The perception of pitch in vibrotactile devices differs from that of normal acoustic instruments. The number of frequency differences is much reduced and depends on amplitude. The skin's maximal frequency response occurs around 250 Hz \cite{gunther2003cutaneous}. There may be as few as five frequency distinctions possible with cutaneous perception, or as many as ten \cite{van2003distilling}.  So, the chromatic range of pitches and frequencies over many octaves as normally represented using music notation is not suitable for cutaneous perception, it appears that some, relatively minor variation in pitch is possible. These considerations would seem not to preclude the use of music notation for our purposes -- the use of notes to represent non-aural sensory expression.\\

%\normalsize \color{red}
%\textbf{Intensity}
%\SMALL{}
%The intensity of a vibrotactile stimulus is defined by the strength or magnitude of its vibration. As with aural music, suitable intensities for vibrotactile devices range from those that are barely perceptual to those that become uncomfortable. Classic work in this area was done by measuring Weber fractions and just noticeable differences (JNDs). Frequency and intensity parameters interact in vibrotactile studies in that differences can be ascribed to combinations of parameters \cite{van2003distilling}. The intensity threshold is adaptable and depends on a variety of parameters such as actuator used, location of the stimulation, person, or frequency of the vibration \cite{jonas2008tactile}. Geldard discovered that while we can discriminate 15 levels of vibrotactile stimuli intensity but that no more than three intensity levels can be identified absolutely \cite{geldard1960some}. Considerations of the amplitude envelope (amplitude, delay, sustain, release, or ADSR) and with amplitude modulations such as tremolo or pitch modulations like vibrato  are also important with vibrotactile stimulation \cite{gunther2003cutaneous}.\\

%\normalsize \color{red}
%\textbf{Duration}
%\SMALL{}
%The term duration refers to the length of the tactile stimulus -- from onset to the termination of the stimulus. There exist various reference values for duration and is generally measured in milliseconds \cite{jonas2008tactile}. It is important to ensure that the individual vibrotactile stimuli are within a reasonable range of durations. Geldard found that stimuli duration roughly between 0.1 and two seconds is reasonable \cite{geldard1960some}. If vibrotactile notes are of short duration they are perceived as sharp taps or jabs in the skin \cite{gunther2003cutaneous}, while stimuli that lasted longer than the upper limit of two seconds delays communication \cite{jonas2008tactile}. Dynamic properties of a vibration signal such as its envelope, duration, and the presence of masking stimuli may also affect perceptual threshold levels \cite{birnbaum2007musical}.\\

%\normalsize \color{red}
%\textbf{Spatial patterns and vibrotactile clues}
%\SMALL{}
%As noted above one of the primary use cases for our vibrotactile device is offer vibrotactile clues about where crystals and treasures can be found within transmedia-inspired gameplay. These clues are intended to provide the following messages to the game-player: \textit{Go this way / don't go that way}, and 
%\textit{You're getting warmer / you're getting colder}. These are spatial and metaphorical in nature and allude to navigating through some kind of virtual space. Panëels discusses vibrotactile design for metaphorical patterns such as \textit{turn back} on devices that have actuators with spatial patterns, but does it in a non-musical context \cite{paneels2013tactiped}. Ideally these gameplay clues are either self-explanatory or easy for the player to learn. A vibrotactile device having a series of tactors activating in the intended direction might be a good first step in suggesting \textit{go this way}, much like a flashing series of traffic lights scrolling to the right suggest proceed to the right (Figure ~\ref{fig:tactorArray}). To test such intuitions requires additional study. One should also note that wrist-worn devices can be oriented in various ways, depending on wrist position.\\

%Music as it is commonly notated does not lend itself to these sorts of concepts or metaphors. Although music that has spatial aspects is common, such as the surround sound of Thomas Tallis' \textit{Spem in Alium} [1570], or the call and response of antiphonal works, standard music notation tends not to focus on the specification of spatial aspects in music performance -- even though aural perception is intensely spatial. In ensembles, sections of instruments playing the same parts are usually placed together but this is a performance convention and is usually outside of the notation itself. Therefore, it is unclear at first what notated music that could be interpreted as \textit{go this way}, or \textit{you're getting warmer} might look like.\\

%\SMALL{}
%Following this line of reasoning, music with one spatial dimension is that which instruments follow some kind of spatial linear progression along one line, such as pan or a sweep. Figure ~\ref{fig:arrowsMoving00}. shows one vibe motor activating in a simple rhythm with a simple, rhythmic pitch change. 
%By the conventions of music notation it is clear that a regular rhythm is being represented. Of course, to appreciate this requires at least a rudimentary knowledge of music notation. To design a pattern of similar rhythmic complexity by means other than music notation would likely be more difficult. \\

%Figure ~\ref{fig:arrowsMoving01}. shows three vibe motors activating in a sequential motion. The motors are arranged along a line and therefore are only one dimensional. Since they are playing the same pitch if the three separate parts where placed on the same staff there would be confusion about which note applies to which motor. Because of their linear placement their pulsation has a directionality. However, this directionality is less apparent in the notation itself. The only indication that Vibe 02 might be located after Vibe 01 is because of the numbering of the score. Yet with vibe bracelets it is desirable to be able to represent two dimensions such that common 2D patterns such as moving sprites, radiating waves and the like can be created across the skin. Is it possible to easily represent the activation of a 2D array of instruments using standard music notation?\\

%With pitched notation the pitch, timing and rhythm of the music tends to be its most important aspect. Time occupies the \textit{x} dimension while pitch occupies the \textit{y}. The spatial placement of the instruments playing different parts is less of a concern. You can have many \textit{parts}, or stack notes in \textit{chords} but this seems only to provide you with one additional dimension. With variables outside of standard notation, such as those that can be accessed though midi channels, additional mappable dimensions may be possible but then this becomes similar to using other programming techniques in which dimensions of information are represented using, for instance, multi-dimensional arrays. The clear graphic presentation of standard music notation, which could be so useful in depicting complex music patterns, would then be lost.\\

%Future Work\\
%\SMALL{}
%Our work consists of quick iteration of devices and authoring of activation patterns for several devices. This work is motivated by both research and aesthetic considerations. Pattern authoring depends crucially on the nature of the device being authored for and its purpose. We consider two aspects that seem particularly promising for future development in this area: the design of vibrotactile patterns to enhance and inform transmedia narratives, and the creation of aesthetically appealing vibrotactile patterns in a variety of musical \textit{genres}. We are also interested in ways of packing more information into standard music notation since it provides a means of representing complex patterns of activation in an elegant form.\\
